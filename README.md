# Mobile-Trainer-Board
My second semester project for my object-oriented programming course. 
A simulation game for the lab work done in my second semester 
Digital Logic Design course.

I am a student in university studying software engineering, and this 
project was my end semester project for my Object Oriented Programming course.
At this time while I am pleased with how my project turned out as my first
project in java and my first time implementing OOP concepts, but at the same
time I recognize how messy the organization of my code is, and how many 
aspects can be immensly improved upon. I hope you all will give me ideas and
educated me in being better at Object Oriented Programming and how to 
improve upon my current project.

Currently I am looking for a proper way to resize images in Java. The last
time I tried a method I found online, it had a bug in it that the image 
corners would crop out when I would zoom in our out.

After I can zoom in and out as much as I like, I will work on making a proper
BreadBoard class that can be added onto the existing breadboards as much as 
one would like, so as to be able to design larger circuits.

After I have accomplished both of these tasks I will add on more components
and try out sequential circuits, but I believe with the way my underlying
logic for electricity is, I might need to completely change the base logic
at some point in time. I would love some ideas on that.
